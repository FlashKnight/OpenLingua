This is a clone of REAL Software's Lingua application for localizing
REALbasic apps. Requires REAL Studio.


Build instructions
===================

Mac
----

When building for Mac OS X, the contents of "Info-addon.plist" in the
Resources folder need to be merged into the build Info.plist file, or
otherwise OpenLingua.app won't be recognited by the Finder to be able to
open .rbl files. To do this merge, open both plist files in a text
editor and copy the <key> and <array> structures into the same level of
the Info.plist file. After that, touch the bundle (.app) folder so that
the Finder takes a new peek at the Info.plist. After that, a right-click
on a .rbl file should offer OpenLingua in the "Open With" submenu even
on a Mac where OpenLingua has never been installed on before.

Cocoa vs. Carbon
-----------------

As of the IDE version 2011r1, Cocoa support is still incomplete. If you
do not need special Cocoa features such as VoiceOver support, I suggest
to build for Carbon therefore.
